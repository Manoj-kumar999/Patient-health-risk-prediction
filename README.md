# 🏥 Patient Health Risk Prediction System

This project uses health data (like glucose, BMI, and age) to **predict whether a patient is at health risk** using **Machine Learning (Logistic Regression)**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- Built a health prediction system using the Diabetes dataset
- Used Logistic Regression to classify patients into **Low Risk** or **High Risk**
- Developed in Jupyter Notebook with full end-to-end pipeline:
  - Data Loading
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Model Training & Evaluation
  - Prediction Function

- Features include:
  - Pregnancies
  - Glucose
  - Blood Pressure
  - Skin Thickness
  - Insulin
  - BMI
  - Diabetes Pedigree Function
